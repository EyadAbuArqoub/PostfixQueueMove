    Notes:
    [1] You must be install "sshpass" on the remote Linux server.

    When I can use this tool?
    If your primary Postfix mail server cannot send emails to the destination and have deferred emails in the queue, for many reasons like:
    [1] Your primary Postfix mail server doesn't reach the destination at network level.
    [2] Your primary Postfix mail server static IP is blacklisted in Real-time Blackhole List (RBL) [Domain Name System-based Blackhole List (DNSBL)], and many mail servers reject the emails which received from your mail server.
    [3] Your primary Postfix mail server was put on blacklist of destination mail server.
    [4] Your primary Postfix mail server has error configuration and not configured well.
